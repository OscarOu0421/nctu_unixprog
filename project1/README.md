# Project1 - "lsof" like program

## Introduction
In this homework, you have to implement the 'lsof' tool by yourself. 'lsof' is a tool to list open files. It can be used to list all the files opened by processes running in the system. The output of your homework is required to strictly follow the spec, the TAs will use the 'diff' tool to compare your output directly against our prepared sample sample testdata. Spaces and tabs are compressed into a single character when comparing the outputs.<br>

A sample output from this homework is demonstrated as follows:
```
$ ./hw1  -c bash

## Program Argument
Your program should work without any arguments. In the meantime, your program have to properly handle the following arguments:
- ```-c REGEX```: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering command line. For example ```-c sh``` would match ```bash```, ```zsh```, and ```share```.
- ```-t TYPE```: a TYPE filter. Valid TYPE includes ```REG```, ```CHR```, ```DIR```, ```FIFO```, ```SOCK```, and ```unknown```. TYPEs other than the listed should be considered as invalid. For invalid types, your program have to print out an error message ```Invalid TYPE``` option. in a single line and terminate your program.
- ```-f REGEX```: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering filenames.

## Requirement
- ```COMMAND```:
  - The executable filename of a running process.
  - DO NOT show arguments.
- ```PID```:
  - Process id of a running process.
  - Only need to handle opened files in process level (check ```/proc/[pid]```. No need to handle opened files in thread level (that would be in ```/proc/[pid]/task/[tid]```).
- ```USER```:
  - The username who run the process.
  - Please show ```username``` instead of UID. 
- ```FD```: The file descriptor. The value shown in ```FD``` field can be one of the following cases.
  - ```cwd```: The current working directory, can be read from ```/proc/[pid]/cwd```.
  - ```root```: root directory, can be read from ```/proc/[pid]/root```.
  - ```exe```: program file of this process, can be read from ```/proc/[pid]/exe```.
  - ```mem```: memory mapping information, can be read from ```/proc/[pid]/maps```.
  - ```del```: indicate that the file or link has been deleted. You should show this value if there is a (deleted) mark right after the filename in memory maps.
  - ```[0-9]+[rwu]```: file descriptor and opened mode.
    - The numbers show the file descriptor number of the opened file.
    - The mode "r" means the file is opened for reading.
    - The mode "w" means the file is opened for writing.
    - The mode "u" means the file is opened for reading and writing.
  - ```NOFD```: if ```/proc/[pid]/fd``` is not accessible. In this case, the values for ```TYPE``` and ```NODE``` field can be left empty.
- ```TYPE```: The type of the opened file. The value shown in ```TYPE``` can be one of the following cases.
  - ```DIR```: a directory. ```cwd``` and ```root``` is also classified as this type.
  - ```REG```: a regular file
  - ```CHR```: a character special file, for example
    ```
    crw-rw-rw- 1 root root 1, 3 Mar 17 17:31 /dev/null
    ```
  - ```FIFO```: a pipe, for examle
    - A link to a pipe, e.g.,
    ```
    lr-x------ 1 terrynini38514 terrynini38514 64 Mar 17 19:55 5 -> 'pipe:[138394]'
    ```
    - A file with ```p``` type (FIFO)
    ```
    prw------- 1 root root 0 Mar 17 19:54 /run/systemd/inhibit/11.ref
    ```
  - ```SOCK```: a socket, for example
    ```
    lrwx------ 1 terrynini38514 terrynini38514 64 Mar 17 19:55 1 -> 'socket:[136975]'
    ```
  - ```unknown```: Any other unlisted types. Alternatively, if a file has been deleted or is not accessible (e.g., permission denied), this column can show ```unknown```.
- ```NODE```:
  - The i-node number of the file
  - It can be blank or empty if and only if ```/proc/[pid]/fd``` is not accessible. 
- ```NAME```:
  - Show the opened filename if it is a typical file or directory.
  - Show ```pipe:[node number]``` if it is a symbolic file to a pipe, e.g.,
  ```
  l-wx------ 1 ta ta 64 三 8 02:11 91 -> 'pipe:[2669735]'
  ```
  - Show ```socket:[node number]``` if it is a symbolic file to a socket, e.g.,
  ```
  lrwx------ 1 ta ta 64 三 8 02:11 51 -> 'socket:[2669792]'
  ```
  - Append  ```(deleted)``` (note the space before the message) to the end of the value if the value for ```FD``` is ```del```.
  - Append  ```(opendir: Permission denied)``` if the access to ```/proc/pid/fd``` is failed due to permission denied.
  - Append  ```(readlink: Permission denied)``` if the access to ```/proc/pid/(cwd|root|exe)``` is failed due to permission denied.
